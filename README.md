The backend offers public and admin api:
### Public

* Get interest points
* Get navigation route between custom geolocation (inside a map) and an interest point
> * More functions as my time allows

### Admin
* Manipulate maps (bounds)
* Manipulate control points
* Manipulate edges between control points thus creating walkable paths
* Manipulate interest points
